  Respond to an eviction
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Respond to an eviction** Easy Form.

  This program helps you respond to an eviction by telling the court and the other parties that you are participating in the court case. It also helps you make an *Eviction Answer, Affirmative Defenses, and Counterclaims* form that tells how you respond to what is written in the complaint.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**understanding an eviction**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/31071).

question: |
  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need: 

  * The Eviction Complaint that you received,
  * Information that supports your defenses like rent payment records, termination notices, or documentation of bad property conditions, if any,
  * Names and addresses of the other parties, and
  * Names and addresses of the other parties' lawyers. 

  You can find this information on the court papers you have about this case. 

  Set aside 10 to 20 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some pages have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that helps explain things.

question: |
  Ways to respond to an eviction case
subquestion: |
  If you are being sued in an eviction case, you have options:
  
  * You can **hire a lawyer** to help you. If you do not have money to hire one, you may be able to find a legal aid lawyer who will help you for free.
  * You can **look for local services** such as legal representation, mediation, rental assistance programs, or other resources to help you resolve the case. You can look for help at [**Eviction Help Illinois**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/evictionhelpillinois) or apply for help by texting "Eviction" to 85622.
  * If you live in Cook County, Cook County Legal Aid for Housing and Debt (CCLAHD) can help resolve housing problems. Visit the [**CCLAHD website**](https://www.cookcountylegalaid.org/) or call 855-956-5763.
  * You can **represent yourself**. If you don't hire a lawyer, there is paperwork you can file to get into the case and defend yourself. This is called appearing “pro se.”
  * You can **do nothing**. If you ignore the lawsuit, you will probably be evicted and a judgment for money may be entered against you.
  
  If you would like help finding free or low-cost legal services in your area, use [**Get Legal Help**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help).

id: eviction forms
continue button field: eviction_forms
question: |
  Forms used when responding to an eviction case
subquestion: |
  This program can help you make several forms that may be useful in your eviction case. Here are some definitions.

  * **Appearance**: Tells the judge and the Plaintiff (for example, the landlord or owner) that you are participating in the case. It also says whether you want a trial by judge only or by judge and jury.
  * **Answer**: Your response to each paragraph in the Eviction Complaint, either all together or one-by-one.
  * **Affirmative Defenses**: Your reasons why the Plaintiff should not win the case even if everything in the complaint is true.
  * **Counterclaims**: Your separate legal claim(s) against the Plaintiff, specifically stating what relief you want from the court. Counterclaims must be directly related to the eviction, or the judge may dismiss them.

  After you download your forms, you must file them with the court. This program **does not** file your forms for you.
  
  To learn more, read the "How to Respond to an Eviction Complaint" instructions you can download at the end of this program.

continue button field: challenge_service
question: |
  Think about defenses
subquestion: |
  There can be many defenses to an eviction lawsuit. However, a few special defenses must be brought up **before** you file your Answer.
  
  You need to file a Motion **before** you file your Answer if you want to:
  
  * Challenge the way the Summons and Complaint were received by you, also called service of process, or
  * Dismiss the Complaint because the lawsuit does not have a legal basis.

  You should talk with a lawyer about whether you have a legal reason to challenge how the Eviction Complaint was received or whether you have a legal reason to have it dismissed.

id: ask if eviction case
question: |
  Are you responding to a residential eviction lawsuit?
subquestion: |
  A residential eviction is a case where a landlord is suing to evict tenants.

  ${ collapse_template(other_evictions_help) }
  
  **Note:** Receiving a **{Notice of Termination}** from your landlord is not the same as being evicted in a lawsuit. If you received an **{Eviction Complaint}** and a **{Summons}** from the sheriff, you were likely sued in court.

fields:
  - no label: eviction_case
    datatype: yesnoradio
terms:
  - Notice of Termination: |
      A notice to a tenant that their lease is ending. A lease can be terminated for different reasons. For example:
      
      * the tenant did not pay rent,
      * the tenant violated a term of the lease, or
      * the landlord does not want to renew the lease at the end of the lease period.
  - Eviction Complaint: |
      A court document used by a landlord to ask the court to evict the tenant.
  - Summons: |
      A notice to a defendant that a lawsuit against them was filed in a court and that the defendant has to show up in court.

question: |
  Appearance and jury trial information
subquestion: |
  This program will make an *Appearance* you can file with the court. Whether or not you have filed a written *Appearance* before your court date, you still must go to court to tell the judge that you want to be a part of the case.

  You have the right to a jury trial. If you want a jury trial, make sure you select that option in this program. This will check the appropriate box on the Appearance form. If you don't check that box, or if you don't file your Appearance before the court date and time on your Eviction Summons, you may lose the right to a jury trial.

  If you haven't requested a jury by the first court date, the judge may give you additional time to do so if you ask, but there is no guarantee you will get extra time.

question: |
  Affirmative defenses
subquestion: |
  Affirmative defenses are reasons why the Plaintiff should not win the case even if everything in the Eviction Complaint is true.
  
  An affirmative defense is not that same as saying "I did nothing wrong." Instead, it is telling the court: "even if you think the landlord is right, I should win because I have this defense."
  
  **Note:** You will have to prove your affirmative defenses in court.
  
  This program will explain the most common affirmative defenses. To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**common eviction defenses**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/31006).

id: notice defense
question: |
  Notice defense
subquestion: |
  If a landlord wants to evict a tenant, they must follow the law in how they notify the tenant. If something was wrong with the Notice you received that told you about the eviction case, that may be a defense to this eviction case.
  
  Note: It does not mean that the landlord can't evict you. It only means that they may have to start over and notify you in the proper way.

  Check all that apply.
fields:
  - Notice problems: notice_defense
    datatype: checkboxes
    #none of the above: False
    choices:
      - __No Notice__ - The landlord says that I did not pay my rent or that I otherwise violated my lease, but I did not get a written notice from the landlord.: no_notice
      - __Improper service of Notice__ - The landlord did not give me notice in a lawful way.: improper_service
      - __Improper Notice__ - The notice did not say the correct number of days or the landlord did not wait the correct number of days before filing the Eviction Complaint.: improper_notice
      - __Inadequate Notice__ - The notice is missing required information like the amount of rent owed or how I violated the lease.: inadequate_notice

id: cure defense
question: |
  Cure defense
subquestion: |
  If the landlord says you violated the lease, and your lease or a local law gives you time to fix or "cure" the problem, that may be a defense to the eviction.

  This affirmative defense is available only if:
  
  * You had a right to fix (cure) the violation, and
  * You did so within the required time period.

  If this does not apply, you can leave this blank.

  **Note:** If you live in Chicago or Cook County, most tenants have a one-time right to stop an eviction for unpaid rent. This is called "pay and stay." You can cure by paying back rent and court costs before a judge signs an Eviction Order. If your building has six units or fewer, this only applies if your landlord does not live in the building.

  - Did you fix the lease violation in time?: cure_defense

question: |
  Bad property conditions defense
subquestion: |
  If the landlord is trying to evict you for not paying rent and the rental property has bad conditions that decreased its value more than the rent you owe, then you may have a defense to the eviction.
  
  Even if the value of the property has been reduced a little by the bad property conditions, this could mean that you owe the landlord less money in unpaid rent. If you do not pay the landlord the full amount you owe, you may be evicted.
  
  Examples of bad property conditions include: water leaking into the apartment, kitchen appliances that don't work, bug or rodent infestations.

question: |
  Retaliation defense
subquestion: |
  You may have a defense of retaliation if you believe the landlord filed the eviction in retaliation for something you did. This means you complained about:

  * a housing condition,
  * a health violation, or
  * another violation

  about the property to an appropriate organization, and the landlord is evicting you for complaining.

  State law only protects you from being evicted if you complain to someone in government about your landlord or unit.

  Chicago, Cook County, and other local jurisdictions may have extra protections for some renters.

  Check all that apply.

subquestion: |
  If the landlord says you violated the lease, but after they learned about the violation they acted like the lease continued, that may be a defense to the eviction.

  After learning about the lease violation, if the landlord signed a new lease or accepted your rent payment, that would be acting like the lease continued.

  This affirmative defense is known as Waiver because the landlord "waived" the right to evict you for that particular lease violation.

question: |
  Counterclaims
subquestion: |
  Illinois law limits what kinds of counterclaims you can raise. They generally must address the right to possession.

  If the judge dismisses your counterclaim because it is not directly related to the eviction, you may have to file an additional lawsuit. To make sure you can do this, ask the judge to dismiss your counterclaim without prejudice.
  
  Counterclaims are like a new lawsuit against your landlord. There will likely be fees to file your counterclaims.
