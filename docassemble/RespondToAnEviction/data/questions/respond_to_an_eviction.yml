  Respond to an eviction
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Respond to an eviction** Easy Form.

  This program helps you respond to an eviction by making an Appearance form that tells the court and the other parties that you are participating in a court case. It also makes an Answer form that tells the court and the other parties how you respond to what is written in the complaint or petition.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**responding to a lawsuit**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32236).

question: |
  Lawsuit information
subquestion: |
  If you received a Complaint or Petition and a Summons, you have been sued. You need to tell the court you want to participate in your case. You tell the court you are participating in the case by filing an **{Appearance}**. In some cases, you need to file an **{Answer}** to respond to the Complaint or Petition.

  The Summons you received will tell you the deadline for filing your Appearance and Answer. If you do not respond by the deadline, you can be found in default, and the court can rule against you.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**responding to a lawsuit**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/32236).

template: response_required_help
subject: |
  **Do I need to file a written Answer?**
content: |  
  There are two kinds of cases where you must appear in person but are not required to file a written Answer:

  * The lawsuit is for money and involves $10,000 or less. This is called a Small Claims case.
  * An eviction lawsuit (formerly called Forcible Entry and Detainer).
  
  Although you are not required to file an Answer before you go to court for these types of cases, the judge might order you to file an Answer after you go to court.

id: challenge service
continue button field: challenge_service
question: |
  Think about defenses
subquestion: |
  There can be many defenses to a lawsuit. However, a few special defenses must be brought up **before** you file your Answer. If you want to:
  
  * Challenge the way the Summons and Complaint or Petition were received by you, also called service of process, or
  * Dismiss the Complaint or Petition because the lawsuit does not have a legal basis,
  
  Then you need to file a Motion **before** you file your Answer.

  You should talk with a lawyer about whether you have a legal reason to challenge how the Complaint or Petition was received or whether you have a legal reason to have it dismissed.
